# 2-11

Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?

a) `int double = 3.14` invalid. there just isn't a name lol
b) `int _` sadly this is valid im pretty sure. plz dont do this
c) `int catch-22` invalid. cant use `-`
d) `int 1_or_2 = 1;` valid
e) `double Double = 3.14;` valid but bad. Capitals should be reserved for things other than primatives imo
